# Get a Grip: Model a Surgical Toolbox and Run the Code for Virtual Robot Arm
From course ENGINEER 1P13 2021 Design Project-2. This project was accomplished as group work. The group was separated in Modelling team and Computational team.

<br>
<br>

## Modelling Team
The objectives included: 

- easy to pick up by gripper
- secure the tool inside steadily
- allow for sterilization (thermal conductivity)

<br>
<br>

The inventor files (parts, assemblies, and drawing dimensions) can be seen in folder.

## Computational Team
The process was:

- determine location of autoclave
- open drawer
- determine location of toolbox
- pick up toolbox
- drop off toolbox at autoclave
- close drawer

<br>
<br>

Some screenshots of codes were taken from my group members. Codes were application in virtual Quanser Lab.
